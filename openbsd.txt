Below is the same flow, but written as individual, copy-paste commands you run by hand.

Do them in order; skip any step that does not apply (e.g. if you are already on the newest release).

0. Become root and make a quick backup / snapshot  
   
```sh
   doas -s && /bin/sh
   ```

1. See how far behind the machine is  
   
```sh
   uname -r
   ftp -V -o - https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/ | awk '/href="[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\//{print $2}' | sort -V | tail -1 | tr -d '/'
   ```

2. Check hardware clock is syncing before anything is timestamped

```sh
rcctl check ntpd || { rcctl enable ntpd; rcctl start ntpd; }

# quick check: are we synced?
ntpctl -s status
   ```

3. Jump to the newest release (only if step 1 shows a newer version)  
   
```sh
   sysupgrade -r         # downloads sets and reboots into the upgrade
   # log back in as root after the reboot
   ```

4. Apply binary patches for the release you now run  
   
```sh
   syspatch
   ```

5. Refresh firmware blobs  
   
```sh
   fw_update
   ```

6. Upgrade every installed package  
   
```sh
   pkg_add -u -v
   ```

7. Merge any changed /etc files  
   
```sh
   sysmerge -d
   sysmerge
   ```

8. Reboot if kernel or libc was touched  
   
```sh
   reboot
   ```

9. Vacuum package database and delete orphaned packages  
   
```sh
   pkg_check
   pkg_delete -a
   ```

10. Remove old kernels and build debris  
    
```sh
    rm -rf /usr/obj/*
    rm -rf /usr/src/sys/arch/$(uname -m)/compile/*
    rm -f /bsd.* /obsd /obsd.rd
    ```

11. Scrub user-specific caches (X11, GNOME, KDE, etc.)  
    
```sh
rm -rf /home/[user]/.cache/*
rm -rf /home/[user]/.config/*
    ```
